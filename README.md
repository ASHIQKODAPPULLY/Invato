## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have:

1. Python 3.8 or higher installed
2. Tesseract OCR installed on your system:
   - Windows: Download from [UB-Mannheim/tesseract](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
   - macOS: `brew install tesseract`
   - Linux: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`
3. Git installed on your system

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/invato.git

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Update Tesseract path in `app.py` (Windows only):
```python
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```
